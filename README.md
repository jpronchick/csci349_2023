This repo contains my work for the Intro to Data Mining course at Bucknell. I'm hoping to learn more about the machine learning algorithms behind language models, such as LSTMs, and understand why they are effective for modeling language. By the end of this semester I hope to be accepted to either a Ph.D. or master's program in computational linguistics or computer science focused in NLP. Broadly I'm interested in computational modeling of cognitive processes, so I have a heavy interest in computer vision as well as NLP.
